# python_api_challenge
Three observations from the API weather data file:
- 589 cities (around the globe) were used in the sample
- As seen by the latitude vs. temperature scatterplot, the data indicates a positive coorelation between high temperatures and locations close to 0 latitude (aka, the equator).  
- When looking at latitude vs. temperature linear regression for the northern/southern hemispheres, I thought it was interesting how their slopes were different. I think this indicates that there's possibly more land for cities to develop in the northern hemisphere. Another possibility is my random sample happened to choose cities further from the equator in the northern hemisphere) compared to cities selected in the southern hemisphere.
